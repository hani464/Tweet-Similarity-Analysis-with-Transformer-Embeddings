# Tweet-Similarity-Analysis-with-Transformer-Embeddings
Tweet Similarity Analysis with Transformer Embeddings
This project aims to build a model that analyzes the semantic similarity of two tweets and provides a similarity score indicating the likelihood that they came from the same user. The model utilizes transformers for text representation and distance calculations.

Dataset
The dataset consists of two columns:

user: The username of the tweet's author.
text: The content of the tweet.
Project Outline
1. Data Preparation
Tweet Pairs Creation: Randomly sample pairs of tweets from the dataset, ensuring a balanced representation of pairs from the same user and different users.
Labeling: Assign a similarity label to each pair (1 for same-user pairs, 0 for different-user pairs).
2. Data Preprocessing
Text Cleaning: Lowercase all text, remove punctuation, symbols, and special characters, tokenize tweets into individual words.
3. Model Architecture
Embedding Layer: Utilize pre-trained embeddings or train the embedding layer with the model.
Transformer Encoder: Select a pre-trained transformer model suitable for text similarity tasks (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT).
Feature Extraction: Use the transformer encoder to extract tweet representations.
Manhattan Distance: Calculate the Manhattan distance between tweet representations.
Dense Layer: Add a dense layer with a sigmoid activation function to produce a similarity score between 0 and 1.
4. Evaluation
Evaluation Metrics: Precision, recall, and F1 score on the testing set.
Usage
